# FAA Wildlife Strikes Analysis - Tableau Project

## Project Overview
For this project, I explored the FAA Wildlife Strikes data from 2000 to 2015. My aim was to use Tableau to uncover trends and patterns in the data.

## Approach
### Data Collection
- Collected the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset, which contains reports from 2000 to 2015.

### Analysis and Visualization
In Tableau, I:
- Created several visualizations to examine different aspects of the data.
- Focused on key categories: cost impact of strikes, timing, and wildlife species.
- Used mapping, time-series analysis, and analytical techniques like forecasting and clustering.
- Searched for patterns, trends, and outliers.

## Questions
1. Which US airports have reported the most strikes over the years?
2. At what time of day and phase of flight do strikes occur most often?
3. At what time of year/months do wildlife strikes happen the most?
4. What species or species groups are causing the highest cost to the airlines due to strikes?
5. Over the years, what states have seen the highest cost to airlines due to strikes?

## Findings
From the analysis, I discovered:
- Common times and locations for wildlife strikes.
- Frequently involved wildlife species.
- Links between various factors and the severity or frequency of strikes.
- Costs associated with the frequency of strikes since 2015.

## Challenges and Learnings
The main challenge was interpreting the large dataset. I learned to identify relevant patterns and present the data effectively.

## Future Plans
Next steps include:
- Developing predictive models to forecast wildlife strikes.
- Further exploring the dataset to understand wildlife strike mitigation efforts.
